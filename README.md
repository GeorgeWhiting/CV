I am an enthusiastic Junior Developer and Physics Graduate looking to start a career in the exciting tech world of London.

Since graduating from Bristol University with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics I have been studying at Makers Academy, an intensive developer bootcamp, in order to improve my ability in a skill that has interested me for years.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct 2017 - Feb 2018)

A Highly selective 12 week developer bootcamp that puts emphasis on:

- Object-oriented design
- Pair programming

- Ruby, Javascript, Java, Swift + iOS SDK
- Rails, Sinatra
- RSpec, Jasmine
- DataMapper, ActiveRecord


#### University of Bristol (Oct 2013 - Jun 2017)

- BSc Physics with Astrophysics
- 2:2
- Including modules in computational physics in C
- Project: ChaMP Radio Sources - Using a linux data reduction package (AIPS) to produce images of radio bright objects

#### Fortismere School and Sixth Form (Sep 2007 - Jun 2013)

- AAAB in Physics, Maths, Biology and Chemistry
- 6A* 6A GCSE's, including 2 foreign languages

## Skills

**Effective communicator**

During my time at University, I had weekly lab sessions and was also involved in group projects. My lab partner and I had regular communication and productive sessions, producing excellent experimental results. In addition to this I frequently take opportunities to coach less experienced players in the sports I take part in. Pair programming is a huge part of the Makers Academy ethos, and is something I look forward to continuing throughout my career. My experiences prior to now have set me up in a position to work efficiently with anyone.

**Fast Learner**

I enjoy learning new skills; from teaching myself to write code in C for my University coursework, to learning a new instrument to fill a gap in the jazz band I played in. These skills came with deadlines attached, so a combination of speed and thoroughness was required in the learning. For my final project at Makers Academy I put the same learning process into effect, learning Swift and the iOS SDK in order to create an appstore-ready puzzle game in just 10 days.

**Additional Skills**

- C
- TeX
- Novice level Spanish and German languages
